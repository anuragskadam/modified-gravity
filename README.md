#  Alternative Gravity Models Using Galactic Rotation Curves : A Machine Learning Analysis  
– Worked on Parameter Estimation of the NFW Dark Matter model on galaxies from the SPARC Database.  
– Followed a paper that used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for parameter fitting and fine-tuned its results
using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Back-Propagation.  
– Achieved a 15% improvement in the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) value.
